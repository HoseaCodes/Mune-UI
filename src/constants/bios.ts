    bio: 'Marques Zahir is the CEO and founder of Mun-e, a groundbreaking financial management app dedicated to financial wellness for Black and Brown communities.<br /><br />Fueled by a desire to see economic equity for people of color, Marques identified a need for financial tools that resonated with the cultural experiences of Black and Brown users. Mun-e goes beyond traditional budgeting apps. It provides financial education that reflects the realities of these communities, dismantles myths surrounding wealth creation specific to their situations, and fosters a supportive online space for users to achieve financial goals together.<br /><br />Before launching Mun-e, Marques thrived in the world of fintech startups and entrepreneurship. However, his true passion resided in closing the racial wealth gap.  He channeled his expertise to develop a platform that celebrates the financial journeys of Black and Brown users, while equipping them with the tools and knowledge to navigate the complexities of personal finance.<br /><br />Marques regularly contributes to financial literacy publications aimed at Black and Brown audiences. His dedication to financial justice extends far beyond the app; Marques actively works to dismantle systemic barriers that hinder wealth creation within these communities.',
